1. 	The logic of my program is that it uses a shared memory space
	to use both quick and mergesort on.

2. 	Well my quicksort works because it splits the array and then sorts. 
	The mergesort works by using a utility function to continually 
	recursively split each array until it finally comes together and 
	sorts by putting them in order.

3. 	Each shared memory was allocated by a random key
	then in the other process used that key to attach.

4. 	No there are not. The sorts are done concurrently.

5. 	I read from the file found the size, determined 
	the left from that as well as the right and then I have
	a dummy variable so it doesn't continually fork. 

6. 	I read in the arrays from the file and find the size of 
	each array and sorts and use a dummy variable to stop
	from forking too much.
